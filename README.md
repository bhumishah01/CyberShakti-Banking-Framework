# CyberShakti — Cybersecurity Framework for Rural Digital Banking

## Quick Start Navigation

- Project index: `docs/REPO_MAP.md`
- Demo runbook: `docs/DEMO_RUNBOOK.md`
- Makefile shortcuts: `make test`, `make metrics`, `make backend`, `make ui`
- Blueprint (human + JSON): `docs/PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md`
- Stepwise progress (Till Midsems): `docs/STEPWISE PROGRESS/TILL MIDSEMS/`
- Stepwise progress (After Midsems): `docs/STEPWISE PROGRESS/AFTER_MIDSEMS/STEPWISE PROGRESS/INDEX.md`

## Run Locally (No Docker)

UI (offline-first demo, SQLite):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn src.ui.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8502 --reload
```

Server API (Postgres/JWT/RBAC):
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill values, then run:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn src.server.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

## Docker (Preferred For Deployment)

Run UI + API + Postgres together:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open:
- UI: `http://127.0.0.1:8502`
- API health: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`

Notes:
- Docker is not required for local development, but it is the cleanest path to a live URL on Render/Fly/Railway.
- The UI writes to SQLite under `data/` (offline-first), and can sync to the API using the outbox manager.

## Deploy (Render)

Render deployment guide (Docker, single live URL):
- `docs/DEPLOY_RENDER.md`

# CyberShakti – Banking Security Framework

## 1. Project Title

**Cybersecurity Framework for Rural Digital Banking**
Developed by Team CyberShakti

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Rural digital banking systems face critical cybersecurity and infrastructure challenges:

* Intermittent or low internet connectivity
* High vulnerability to phishing and fraud
* Centralized storage risks
* Delayed breach detection
* Low digital literacy among users
* Insecure data transmission over public networks

Most banking platforms rely on continuous internet connectivity for authentication, verification, and storage. This creates a security gap in rural environments where connectivity is unreliable.

There is a need for a secure, offline-first cybersecurity framework that protects user data locally and synchronizes securely when connectivity is stable.

---

## 3. Objective

To design and develop a cybersecurity framework that:

* Works efficiently in low-connectivity rural environments
* Stores sensitive user data locally in encrypted form
* Verifies and validates user inputs offline
* Prevents real-time data exposure over insecure networks
* Synchronizes securely with central servers during safe network windows
* Provides a scalable architecture deployable across rural banking kiosks, micro-ATMs, and mobile banking agents

---

## 4. Proposed Solution Overview

The framework introduces an **Offline-First Secure Banking Architecture**.

Instead of transmitting user data immediately:

1. Data is captured locally.
2. Stored in encrypted SQLite databases.
3. Verified using local validation engines.
4. Queued for synchronization.
5. Synced to central banking servers during:

   * Night hours
   * Low traffic windows
   * Secure network availability

This reduces real-time attack surfaces and protects sensitive rural user data.

---

## 5. Key Innovations

### 5.1 Offline-First Security Model

All sensitive operations are executed locally before cloud transmission.

### 5.2 Local Encrypted Storage

User credentials and transaction metadata are stored in encrypted SQLite databases.

### 5.3 Delayed Secure Synchronization

Data sync occurs only during predefined safe windows.

### 5.4 Fraud Risk Buffering

Suspicious activities can be flagged locally before central escalation.

### 5.5 Rural Connectivity Optimization

Framework functions even with zero internet availability.
